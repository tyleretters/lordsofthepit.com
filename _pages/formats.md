## Old School 93-94 Rules

**All Old School 93-94 tournaments that Eternal Central hosts will use the rules below.**

Note: last updated September 7, 2019. EC Old School uses the current [London Mulligan rule.](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/london-mulligan-2019-06-03)

**Legal Sets**

**Old School 93-94 decks may consist of cards from these sets printed in 1993-94:**
- *Alpha*
- *Beta*
- *Unlimited*
- *Collector’s Edition (CE)*
- *International Collector’s Edition (IE)*
- *Arabian Nights*
- *Antiquities*
- *Revised*
- *Legends*
- *The Dark*
- *Fallen Empires*

**Additional Sets and Cards Allowed (ie. REPRINTS)**

Tournaments hosted by Eternal Central also allow all non-foil cards from the sets above, that were reprinted IN ANY LANGUAGE with the original frame and original art. So for example, a *Chronicles* City of Brass, *Fifth Edition* Wrath of God, *Time Spiral* Psionic Blast, and *Collector’s Edition* Mox Ruby would all be legal (original frame + original art), while an *Ice Age* Swords to Plowshares or *Arena 1996* Counterspell would not be legal (different art). The misprinted *Revised* Serendib Efreet (with Ifh-Biff Efreet’s art, and green border) is of course allowed, because it was printed in one of the original sets in 1994 *(Revised)*. We always encourage you to seek out the oldest and coolest versions of cards you can find, but these can serve as your de facto substitutes for the cards printed in 93-94. Absolutely no proxies and fake cards allowed. Finally, the following promotional cards from 1994 are also legal: Arena, Sewers of Estark, and Nalathni Dragon.

**Deck Construction**

Constructed decks must contain a minimum of 60 cards (no maximum deck size; however, you must be able to shuffle your deck with no assistance). If a player wishes to use a sideboard, it can contain up to 15 cards. With the exception of basic land cards (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest), a player’s combined deck and sideboard may not contain more than 4 of any individual card, counted by its English card title equivalent.

**The following cards are banned by EC in 93-94 tournaments:**
- Bronze Tablet
- Contract from Below
- Darkpact
- Demonic Attorney
- Jeweled Bird
- Rebirth
- Tempest Efreet

**The following cards are restricted by EC in 93-94 tournaments (maximum of 1 of each card per deck):**
- Ancestral Recall
- Balance
- Black Lotus
- Braingeyser
- Chaos Orb
- Channel
- Demonic Tutor
- Library of Alexandria
- Mana Drain
- Mind Twist
- Mox Emerald
- Mox Jet
- Mox Pearl
- Mox Ruby
- Mox Sapphire
- Recall
- Regrowth
- Sol Ring
- Time Vault
- Time Walk
- Timetwister
- Wheel of Fortune

**Notable Rules/Differences from Modern Era of Magic**
- MANA BURN STILL HAPPENS (as in, players lose 1 point of life for each unused mana in the mana pool at the end of each phase)
- THE FOLLOWING CARDS WILL HAVE THE UPDATED ORACLE TEXT, AS SHOWN BELOW:

Chaos Orb
2
Artifact
1, Tap: Choose a nontoken permanent on the battlefield. If Chaos Orb is on the battlefield, flip Chaos Orb onto the battlefield from a height of at least one foot. If Chaos Orb turns over completely at least 360 degrees during the flip, and lands resting on the chosen permanent, destroy that permanent. Then destroy Chaos Orb.
(Note: because of how Chaos Orb is worded, with it being destroyed after a flip, it can still be Disenchanted or Shattered in response to the activation, which will nullify the ability to flip, since it is no longer on the battlefield. This is consistent with the wording of Chaos Orb not being sacrificed upon activation, as it probably would with modern templating. Also note that Chaos Orb chooses, but does not target.)

Falling Star
2R
Sorcery
Choose any number of non-overlapping creatures on the battlefield. Flip Falling Star from at least a height of one foot. If Falling Star turns over completely at least 360 degrees during the flip, it deals 3 damage to each chosen creature it lands resting on. Any creatures damaged by Falling Star that are not destroyed become tapped.
(Note: Falling Star chooses upon resolution, but does not target.)

Ring of Ma’rûf
5
Artifact
5, Tap, Exile Ring of Ma’rûf: The next time you would draw a card this turn, instead choose a card you own from exile or from your sideboard, and put it into your hand.

**No Draws in EC Tournaments**

In order to encourage the maximum amount of Magic and matches being played (and disincentivize draws and concession for seeding), we enforce a strict no draw policy (intentional or otherwise). After 50 minutes if there was a tied match, the tie breaker will be a sudden death Chaos Orb flipping contest, similar to a hockey or soccer overtime shootout. If both players make or miss the Chaos Orb flip in the same round, repeat the process. The first person to make it while the other person misses will be declared the winner of the match. The point of Old School is to play Old School, so we always encourage everyone to play quickly and have fun each round, and this tournament structure has worked very well to that end.

**Additional Sets and Cards Allowed**

Tournaments hosted by Eternal Central also allow all cards from the following box sets and special releases which were printed during the era: *Pro Tour Collector Set Inaugural Edition* (May 1996), *Anthologies* (November 1998), *Battle Royal Box Set* (November 1999), *Beatdown Box Set* (December 2000), *Deckmasters: Garfield vs. Finkel* (September 2001), *World Championship Decks* 1997-2003. Finally, the following cards that were Book Promos from the era are also legal: Arena, Sewers of Estark, Nalathni Dragon, Giant Badger, and Windseeker Centaur (note: Mana Crypt is banned). Arena League and DCI Membership Promos from the era (Fireball, Counterspell, Disenchant, Incinerate basic lands, etc.) are also legal in Middle School.

Due to bogus behavior by investors and speculators for the past few years driving up the costs of cards beyond normal market machinations, we will allow any reprints of these cards to be played, including Collector’s Edition/International Collector’s Edition, World Championship, artist proofs, etc. Even though it goes against the original aesthetic and theme of the format, we will also begrudgingly allow modern bordered reprints of these cards to be played in Middle School. We always encourage you to seek out the oldest and best looking versions of cards you can find, but these newer or more affordable versions can always serve as your de facto substitutes for the original printings of the cards. Absolutely no proxies and fake cards are allowed.

**Deck Construction**

Constructed decks must contain a minimum of 60 cards (no maximum deck size; however, you must be able to shuffle your deck with no assistance). If a player wishes to use a sideboard, it can contain up to 15 cards. With the exception of basic land cards (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest), a player’s combined deck and sideboard may not contain more than 4 of any individual card, counted by its English card title equivalent. There is no Restricted List in Middle School, but there is a Banned List of cards that may not be used.

**The following cards are banned by EC in Middle School tournaments:**
- Amulet of Quoz
- Balance
- Brainstorm
- Bronze Tablet
- Channel
- Dark Ritual
- Demonic Consultation
- Flash
- Goblin Recruiter
- Imperial Seal
- Jeweled Bird
- Lion’s Eye Diamond
- Mana Crypt
- Mana Vault
- Memory Jar
- Mind’s Desire
- Mind Twist
- Rebirth
- Strip Mine
- Tempest Efreet
- Timmerian Fiends
- Tolarian Academy
- Vampiric Tutor
- Windfall
- Yawgmoth’s Bargain
- Yawgmoth’s Will

We are constantly monitoring the decks and cards in the format to ascertain if anything needs to be modified as time passes.

**Notable Rules/Differences from Modern Era of Magic**

Additionally, there are a few important rules differences between Middle School and the way modern Magic has mutated over time:
- Mana Burn Happens (as in, players lose 1 point of life for each unused mana in the mana pool at the end of each phase).
- The Judgment Wish Cycle Works as Originally Designed, Pre-M10 Rules Change (as in, Cunning Wish, Burning Wish, Living Wish, Death Wish, and Golden Wish were originally able to find an appropriate card that had either been removed from the game, or was located in your sideboard. The Wish cycle functionality has been restored to allow this).
- Damage Uses the Stack (as it did with Sixth Edition rules for example, so combat tricks such as Morphling, Triskelion, and Mogg Fanatic work).

Sixth Edition Style: C.1.Ruling.3

The combat phase can be mapped in a longer form like this:
1. Triggers on “beginning of combat,” then chance for instants and abilities.
2. Declare attackers.
3. Triggers on attack declaration, then chance for instants and abilities.
4. Declare blockers.
5. Triggers on block declaration, then chance for instants and abilities.
6. Assign combat damage (but don’t deal it yet)
7. Chance for instants and abilities.
8. Deal combat damage.
9. Triggers on damage being dealt, then chance for instants and abilities.
10. Triggers on “end of combat,” then chance for instants and abilities.

We strongly feel that these specific older rules make for significantly better and more compelling game play, with more strategic depth. Everything else in Middle School works the same as modern Magic rules (current London Mulligan rule, etc.).

**Draws in EC Tournaments**

As of right now, there is no official and explicit rule against drawing in Middle School tournaments (yet). This is a departure from our policy in other Old School tournaments (In order to encourage the maximum amount of Magic and matches being played, and disincentivize draws and concession for seeding, we normally enforce a strict no draw policy, intentional or otherwise). We are still experimenting with solutions at different events we run, and this will be revisited and updated accordingly when necessary.

Finally, the following promotional cards are also legal in Classic Magic: Arena, Sewers of Estark, Nalathni Dragon, Giant Badger, Windseeker Centaur, and Mana Crypt (note: Mana Crypt is restricted).

- DAMAGE USES THE STACK (as in, combat tricks such as Morphling, Triskelion, and Mogg Fanatic work).
- THE WISH CYCLE RETURNS TO ORIGINAL (PRE-M10) FUNCTIONALITY (as in, Cunning Wish, Burning Wish, Living Wish, Death Wish, and Golden Wish were originally able to find an appropriate card that had either been removed from the game, or was located in your sideboard. The Wish cycle functionality has been restored to allow this).
- THE FOLLOWING CARDS WILL HAVE THE UPDATED ORACLE TEXT, AS SHOWN BELOW:

Time Vault
2
Artifact
Time Vault comes into play tapped.
Time Vault doesn’t untap during your untap step.
Skip your next turn: Untap Time Vault and put a time counter on it.
T, Remove a time counter from Time Vault: Take an extra turn after this one. Play this ability if only there’s a time counter on Time Vault.

Illusionary Mask
2
Artifact
X: : Put a creature card with converted mana cost X or less from your hand into play face down as a 0/1 creature. Put X mask counters on that creature. Play this ability only any time you could play a sorcery. You may turn the creature face up any time you could play an instant by removing all mask counters from it.
*Note: this is similar to how Illusionary Mask worked in a previous rules update, prior to the modern wording.*
