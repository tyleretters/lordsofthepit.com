## Lords' Haüs 2: The Sequel

---

In early spring of the year 2020, the world began to irreparably change forever. An event begins to throw governments across the globe into crisis. Eventually, all of humanity had to shelter in place to avoid the danger and risk of infection. This new plague is now known the world over as Lords' Haüs. More than two years later as the dust finally starts to settle, the survivors of the first Lords' Haüs are making plans to converge again on the sleepy town of Monroe Center, IL. The time is neigh.

## Event Details

Lords' Haüs 2 will take place March 10th - 13th, 2022 at [Kilbuck Creek in Monroe Center, IL.](https://www.kilbuckcreek.com/retreats) Check in begins at 3pm Thursday, March 10th, 2022 and check out is at 10am Sunday, March 13th, 2022. In order to make up for lost time, this iteration will take place across three evenings. Unfortunately there will not be any partial/prorated bookings accepted.

The venue is about 90 minutes west of Chicago. We will work to plan carpools for all that need them, including those flying in.

Snacks, breakfasts, catered lunches and catered dinners will be provided. Please include food allergies or dietary restrictions with your registration. Booze and grass are all BYOB, so please plan ahead and bring whatever you like.

Amenities include an indoor pool & hot tub, living room bird cage, six bathrooms, one urinal, and more bunk beds than Heaven's Gate. There will be ancillary activities throughout the event, all of which will be announced at a later date. The weather will be moderately more favorable, so there may be some opportunity for outdoor activities. If you would like to host an activity or have specific requests for events, please reach out.
