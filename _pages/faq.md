## Who are the Lords of the Pit?

---

The Lords of the Pit are the United States' premiere Old School Magic: the Gathering club based out of Chicago, IL. Members of this group include current club members ("Lords") as well as prospective new members ("Thrulls").

Membership in the Lords of the Pit is based on active involvement in our events and contributions to our cause -- the proliferation of Old School MTG in the United States, improving the world through our club's charitable contributions & community service, and fierce representation of our club.

We value equality, inclusivity, tolerance and, of course, slinging old cardboard. Lords of the Pit events are a safe space for friends and strangers alike and are a catalyst for charitable giving to numerous Chicago-area organizations* as nominated by our members.

## I'm new to Old School; will I be welcome at your next meetup?
