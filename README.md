# Lords of the Pit

1. See `_editors` folder for post templates.
2. Images go into `assets/images/YYYY/`. See examples of other posts for how to correctly include them in your posts.
4. Large files (such as PDFs for the Arcanaeum) need to be added to our S3 bucket. Contact @tyleretters to help with this.
3. After committing to the master branch, changes will automatically push to production. This takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.

You can work entirely in GitHub, but you won't be able to preview your changes until they're live on the site. If you'd like to preview your changes, you need to talk with @tyleretters to setup your local development enivronment. Or you can try these tutorials: [Official Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) or [A Tutorial Tyler Wrote](https://journal.highlandsolutions.com/developing-with-jekyll-for-beginners-f29f3f3f93e3?source=---------5------------------).
