*“Does anybody have an extra deck?”*

This was how Middle School Marauders: The Return began. Lord Michael Walker showed up to have a couple beverages and innocently observe games having never played Middle School before; but with the Lords of the Pit, if you show up, you pair up. Walker’s inclusion made an even 18 ballers, perfect for the tight confines of DMen Tap’s back room. Lord Tim Baran had a spare brew (Madness), and thusly we equipped Walker and fired Round 1.

Harsh winds and lake effect snow may have battered Chicago into submission, but on this fine, late-January afternoon the Lords & Co. gathered to reignite the flame of Middle School MTG, that distinctual, finely-aged format covering *Fourth Edition* through *Scourge*. For those that may not remember (hey, it’s been a couple years), you can read Lord Jaco’s format primer [here](https://www.eternalcentral.com/middleschoolrules/).

At Marauders, the Lords chose to support [My Block My Hood My City](https://www.formyblock.org/mission), an organization that coordinates volunteers across the City of Chicago, raising over $300 for their benefit.

After five rounds of Swiss pairings, one mage stood apart from the rest as our own MTG Meatball, Lord Carter Petray, slew the competition with his English Breakfast feat. Stiflenought. After a morning spent hanging lighting fixtures at Lord Moss’ Logan Square fortress (big ups to Meatball Electric!) his 5-0 list dodged enough graveyard hate to grind Ws using the likes of Phage, Akroma and Noughts. The remaining 4-1 lists included Lord Nick Rohr’s Monowhite Shadowgeddon, Southsider Enrique Flores’ Monoblack Necro, and Lord Nathan Mullen’s BG Madness. (A scrivener’s error listed Mullen at 3-2 in the final standings, but as noted in his tasteful deck pic below, he was upon further review awarded the extra W ex post facto.)

The remainder of the field saw a plethora of ill MS technology: newcomer Ben Jones wielded a sharp monoblack Rack/Wheel of Torture deck, Lord Andy MacDougall herded squirrels via Enchantress, Lord Greg Kotscharjan ran with Esper Wizards (all Japanese for maximum angle-shooting) and Lord Baran unleashed a Draco/Erratic Explosion combo. While multiple iterations of Tax/Rack circulated the room, we kept the durdling to a minimum.

With Middle School Marauders now successfully relaunched, the Lords look to ride out the mid-winter doldrums and await further misadventures in 2022…
