## Summer's End

![](/assets/images/banners/vamp.jpg)

It was a sunny and mild early September Saturday, perfect for enjoying a bike ride, backyard barbeque… or shutting oneself indoors to playing Old School Magic: the Gathering on a webcam versus twelve pals. Thusly we found ourselves, thirteen wayward mages, waylaid by the pervasive oddity that is This Year 2020, sleeving up, logging in, adjusting our lighting and grinding out games in search of the almighty doubleyou. Thanks to the organizing efforts of Lord Punts, who’s served as the Lords’ lodestar by which we’ve managed to navigate these troubled times using online meetups to maintain club activity, we circled the wagons for a “family only” Gathering. No outsiders allowed this time, only the gnarliest Lords.

To that end, we picked up right where we left off. Maybe there was a little rust in our Orb flipping, as anecdotal evidence of more misses than usual crept into The Pit, the video chat channel used for trash talking between rounds. Meanwhile, our “tables” for the rounds were video chat rooms named for the classic LOTP hotspots around the City: DMen, Map Room, Hopewell, Rev, Bob’s Backyard, and the recently-departed Crown Liquors (RIP). The field offered a nice snapshot of classic archetypes and current villains: UR Burn, RUG Aggro, Monowhite, Esper Aggro, White Prison, Underworld Trix and Atogs (RUG and a White variant) among others. See our gallery below for all the technological glory.

After five rounds of Swiss + 1, it was our illustrious Meatball that proved undefeatable, sweeping the afternoon with his patented RUG Atog pile. It seems that Lord Petray, having not died a hero, has now seen himself live long enough to become the villain. His prize for successful grinding? Continued one-on-one road running sessions with the merciless Bulu Master. Luckily for R-Kid, the 90 degree temperatures seem to have abated for the season.

Can anything be taken away from this (or any) online “tournament”? The actual gameplay suffers in this environment, no doubt, but assembling in The Pit or catching up before/after rounds is the trve value of a virtual Gathering. Absence in these odd times, have indeed made hearts grow fonder, but though we may be distant, that doesn’t mean we must remain apart.
