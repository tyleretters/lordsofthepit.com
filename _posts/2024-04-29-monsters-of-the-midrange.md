Twenty-one Lords & Co. gathered at the stalwart confines of DMen Tap on 4/20/2024 for the fifth installment of our Relic War, Chicago’s (pseudo) annual tip of the cap to Swedish OS MTG.

In an afternoon filled with stews and brews – made safe for mid-rangey lists and greedy mana bases by virtue of restricted Strip Mine – it was Lord Tim Baran who stood undefeated atop a pile of vanquished foes. Tim played 5C Sedge Troll Goodstuff.

See our deck list gallery below for the club’s other takes on Swedish OS.

Also, special shout out to that one wack dude who played loud-ass Venom pinball the whole day. An anonymous Lord – as well as the machine, probably – were tilting.
