**TYLER, PLEASE USE DANCE OF THE DEAD AS A HEADER IMAGE.**

It may be hard to believe but Fall Brawl is the longest running annual OS meetup we have in Chicago. Now in its seventh year, the lion’s share of Fall Brawls have taken place in DMen Tap’s backroom, where on this cool Saturday in November, twenty aged but able mages found themselves shuffling up and throwing down. A few newcomers joined in the spellslinging, too, bringing some fresh faces to the otherwise ever-haggard assemblage of dudesweats.

The Gathering began with a queue of black-clad fellas outside DMen, awaiting doors to unlock at noon. With telltale backpacks in-tow, any well-versed observer along Belmont Ave. would surely recognize and appreciate the fearsome sweathoggery about to uncoil. After a half hour of beverages and small talk, we fired Round 1.

The Fall Brawl field was Necro-light this year, with just one such list (JP) among the T8. Shops (Baran), Stasis (Petray) and Willowgeddon (Semmens) were among the other top decks. A surplus of Zuran Orbs lengthened plenty of games and seemed to be the overall most-played ‘95 card in the room. Following five rounds, Lord Tim Baran emerged undefeated with a Shops list featuring Jester’s Cap. Lord Robert Vincent, meanwhile, took the award for most ‘95 cards used (12) and a copy of *The Duelist* issue no. 5 (June 1995).

Following a hiatus, the Lords are pleased to bring back the LOTP Toy Drive for 2024, spearheaded by our very own Lord Petray. The drive will benefit Children’s Charity of Orland Park, and the Lords are collecting toys & donations up until December’s Holly Jolly Chaos IV event.
