**Prelude**

Seven Hundred Days, that’s how long it had been since the Lords of the Pit gathered for a tournament in the City of Chicago -- Party of the Pit Lords II at Bridgeport’s Marz Community Brewing Company on December 14, 2019. Stop for a moment and contemplate all that’s changed during those 700 days: some of us have moved, changing zip codes or time zones, some started new studies or graduated, started new relationships or jobs, bought homes, added to our families and said goodbye to loved ones. So much life has happened since we last Gathered, so much of the world around us has changed and yet, as the wheel now grinds toward 2022, we found ourselves back together, battling like it’s 1995.

Thankfully, DMen Tap, the Lords’ unofficially official clubhouse on Belmont, weathered the pandemic shitstorm and remembered us when we came calling. The Lords of the Pit had returned.

2021 Lords of the Pit Toy Drive

Anyone familiar with Lords events knows we select a charitable organization to support. In 2019, we held consecutive toy drive-themed events for donation to Cradles to Crayon. For Fall Brawl 4, the Lords chose to run back that plan with our adopted organization being the WGN Morning News / Chicago Parks District Toy Drive [link] and the boys turned out a generous haul of toys.

A Brief History of OS95 in Chicago, and The Putsch

The Fall Brawl has served as the Lords’ yearly foray into the world of OS95 MTG, that tangy blend of 93/94 plus Ice Age and Homelands added for extra zip. OS95 adds just enough utility, power level, and cool jank to enhance the Old School flavor without overpowering its richness. OS95 first entered our consciousness with a January, 2017 meetup at Essen Haus following the first Madison Offensive event. That night, Johnny Beste went undefeated with a 95 Reanimator list. The second OS95 meetup (spring 2018) was part of a split format, 93/94 & 95 challenge at Lord Jaco’s West Chicago fortress. That day, Lord Greg Kotscharjan took first place; his 95 brew leaned heavily on UW. Later that year began the Fall Brawl series. The first such battle was held that October at DMen. Again, Reanimator paced the field, with Jaco finishing 6-0 in first and Lord Moss finishing 5-1 in second (my sole loss to Jaco). Determined to stop Reanimator, Lord Petray cracked the code at the second Fall Brawl (October 2019) at Metropolitan Brewing along the Chicago River. Petray went undefeated on a Tax Edge list that featured… a single Zuran Orb. The 2020 Fall Brawl was hosted in the digital realm. It was an enjoyable distraction for an otherwise chaotic world. We again adopted the split format, this time combining regular OS95 with 95 Singleton. Lord Danny Friedman took down the two batches before using a mighty Necro-Chasm-Lich-Mirror-Fastbond stew to dispatch Petray in the finals and prevent our first back-to-back champion.

Interestingly, those first couple OS95 meetups allowed for unrestricted Demonic Consultation. That certainly aided Reanimator’s plan to get Bazaar of Baghdad on the board as soon as possible. Following the 2018 Fall Brawl, and in an effort to slow down Reanimator, the Lords added DC to the Restricted List. For 2021, I asked the question: was this really necessary? Weren’t we also punishing fun combo decks? Besides, if we were only going to play OS95 once per year, and if this was going to be our first shindig in nearly two years, shouldn’t we opt for more, rather than less, busted plays? Lord Elleman was all-in, he’d probably a plan to eek out a few win% points with it. Lord Agra was aghast; how could he possibly contemplate a rules change that wasn’t force-fed to him via eternalcentral.com? Lord Semmens, ever the diplomat, offered a compromise: he would support unrestricted DC if I promised not to play Reanimator. I could never so callously scorn my beloved deck. Undaunted, I tried an end-around this LOTP braintrust via full club vote-a-rama. Votes, hot takes and shit takes rained down from across the peanut gallery and when the dust settled the motion fell, 14 - 11. DC would remain fettered for another year.

Chimichangas & Anticipation

Crisp air and cloudy skies greeted us on Saturday morning. Thankfully, the previous evening’s wintery storm failed to turn Chicago into a Snow-Covered Land. A small cadre of Lords met at Wicker Park’s Handlebar for a breakfast of bloody marys, coffee and chimichangas. After a bit of shit talking, we departed for a Pit stop at the Map Room before rolling up to DMen. I knew it’d be a good day when my wagon pulled up across the street for a bulu-tiered parking spot. I could feel the permeating dudesweat when I stepped through the door as several folk milled about. Lots of flannel. Even more black attire. The Meatball rolled in claiming to be the second coming of Deer Hunter-era Christopher Walken, confusing anyone gifted with eyesight. Not much had changed in the back room at DMen in the last 700 days, save for the recent(ish?) addition of an AD&D pinball machine. Thus the rituals began: we piled up toys for the drive, checked in with Lord Agra (who deftly handled pairings), and signed the “loots.” Lord Rohr handed out custom Fall Brawl patches and I handed out a small stash of Brainstorm-themed pins as a gang assembled at the bar, greeting/heckling stragglers. A few last-second trades and lends completed decks and we fired Round One.

It’s Happening!

As my friends sleeved up Tormod’s Crypts with visions of my heartache fueling their wettest of dreams, I decided to keep my beloved Reanimator on ice and deked with a call-back to Marz ‘19 and my patented Understanding White Weenie™ (1995 Edition). With Bob handling pairings and results, I was free to unleash my one-man Crusade through five rounds. Col. Sanders was felled so fast in round one I didn’t even realize he was on a Lich stew. Needless to say, it was sent back to the kitchen for additional seasoning. Round two gave me a chance at revenge against Southsider Enrique Flores, who was my sole loss back at Marz. I felt good about my smoking hot G1, but Enrique unloaded a Swamp-Lotus-double Order of the Ebon Hand against me to open G2 and I was balled. G3 went pear-shaped when a timely Strip and Hymn nuked my mana base. My vengeance will have to wait another day. In round three, I met Wisconsinite Danny Dunaway… in a mirror match? His version splashed red for Bolts while mine splashed blue for cheese. I stayed one Strip, er, step ahead of Danny and left him thunderstruck by my Thunder Spirits.

Round four paired me with Lord Andy MacDougall, my only interclub pairing for the day. He was on a monoblack land destruction deck. It didn’t fare well for my dude, who got mana screwed and overrun in Game 2. Finally, Bob called out the final round’s pairings and I drew the glacially-minded Matt Braun, whose first four rounds went to time. I was determined not to. Game one he got chipped mostly by his own mana base (Adarkar Wastes and City of Brass). Game two was a dogfight and I enough weenie mojo to get there. The key play was when an Icatian fell on his own javelin so I could Balance away Braun’s Serra… and hand. I badgered Braun quite a bit, but hey we got in before time was called! The Weenies finished the day a respectable 4-1, yet I won’t be able to look my Ashen Ghouls in the eye for the next 12 months.

Meanwhile, at the top-table, it was Lord Tim Baran’s 5C Necro Goodstuff list that vanquished the field with a sterling 5-0 record. Tim admitted he needed another wincon or two as many of his matches went close to time. His sole reward for the day’s grinding was the “Real Q-Cup,” a tumbler filled with leftover from the Lords’ round of Malort shots earlier in the day. Needless to say, it was probably for the best that Tim declined to swill the swill. Necro took the top two spots of the Swiss, in fact, with Lord Elleman’s Esper Necro Mirror deck close behind Tim. My WW and Cayce’s RUG rounded out the T4.

The only “prize” we had to offer was an altered Brainstorm (special thanks to Cam Wall for the effort!) that went to whomever used the most cards original to ‘95 sets *Ice Age* and *Homelands*. Not to be outdone, it was Lord Nick Rohr, on a deck built entirely from the two sets, who claimed the honor. A brainstorm, indeed. His pile even managed a single win, much to Nick’s own surprise. After taking the prize in ‘19 and ‘21, does anyone have what it takes to play more ‘95 cards than this madman?

Wrap

After all the anticipation, the Fall Brawl passed like a glorious blur. It wasn’t overwhelming, in fact it felt just right, just as it always does, just as we remembered it. That groove was right there waiting for us to find it once again. To say that I’m privileged to be part of such a wonderful group of gnarly man-child gamer dudes would be an understatement, so I’ll just end this report the way we ended Fall Brawl… “see you in December!”

Appendix: Note on COVID-19 Vaccines

Prior to Fall Brawl 4, and for future events, the Lords of the Pit required entrants to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19. All 24 Fall Brawl entrants provided proof without hesitation. While I was uneasy asking for this information, I’m thankful they made it easy for me. We all have a role to play in protecting one another.
