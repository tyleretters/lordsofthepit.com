[TYLER, PLEASE USE SEDGE TROLL AS OUR BANNER IMAGE.]

Twenty-one Lords & Friends gathered at the venerable DMen Tap on 4/20/2024 for our fifth installment of the Relic War, Chicago’s (pseudo) annual tip of the cap toward Swedish OS MTG.

In an afternoon filled with stews and brews – made safe for mid-rangey lists and greedy mana bases by virtue of restricted Strip Mine – it was Lord Tim Baran who stood undefeated atop a pile of vanquished foes. Tim played a 5C Sedge Troll Goodstuff list.

See our deck list gallery below for the club’s other takes on Swedish OS.

Also, special shout out to that one wack dude who played loud-ass Venom pinball the whole time we jammed games. An anonymous Lord – as well as the machine, probably – were tilted.
