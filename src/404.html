      We just migrated lordsofthepit.com to
      <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> so try the
      <a href="/archives">Archives</a> for a list of all our posts. Also please
      note, dear planeswalker, that any documents from the
      <a href="/arcanaeum">Arcanaeum</a> are now hosted in an S3 bucket. All
      those links are different, too.
